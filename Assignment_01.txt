1.What is Emmet?
=> Emmet is typically integrated into code editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)
 like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.
  It has become an essential tool for many web developers, as it improves their workflow and increases productivity when working on HTML and CSS projects.

2.Difference between library and framework?
=>The main distinction between a framework and a library is that a framework inverts program control. 
It informs the developer of what they require. 
A library, however, does not. Instead, a programmer calls the library when and where he needs it.

3. What is CDN ? why do we use it?
=>CDNs work by caching content in multiple edge servers strategically placed in different regions.
 When a user requests a particular piece of content,
  the CDN serves it from the edge server closest to the user's location, 
  rather than from the origin server where the content is originally hosted. 
This proximity reduces the latency and network congestion, 
resulting in faster content delivery.

4. What is crossorigin in the script tag?
=>The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.

5. What is Difference between React and ReactDOM?
=>React is the core library for building user interfaces, 
while ReactDOM is the package that facilitates rendering those components into the browser's DOM. 
React focuses on the component-based architecture and managing state,
 while ReactDOM handles the rendering and updating of those components in the browser.

 6.What is the different between react.Development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
 =>webpack - Difference between production and development build ...
The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging and often times hot reloading ability in those builds. 
The production build, on the other hand, 
runs in production mode which means this is the code running on your client's machine.

7.what are async and defer?
=>Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, 
without blocking other elements on the page. Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading.
 In most cases, async is the better option â€” but there are exceptions.
